            <strong>4.6.</strong> Termination by Julio Sales Group. Julio Sales Group may at any time terminate your
            account if:

            inconsistently with this ToU or (b) engaging in fraudulent or illegal activities or other conduct that may

            <h3> 16.Indemnification.</h3>
            You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Julio Sales Group and the Related
            Parties
            harmless from any and all claims, demands, damages or other losses including, without limitation, reasonable
            attorneys’ fees, resulting from or arising out of (i) your use of the Site and/or the Service or (ii) your
            breach of this ToU or any other policies that Julio Sales Group may issue for the Site and/or the Service
            from time to time.
            <br /> <br />





            <h3>17.Governing Law; </h3>
            Jurisdiction.This ToU is governed by Florida law, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The
            application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
            excluded. You and Julio Sales Group agree that, except as otherwise provided in Section 18 below, the state
            and federal courts located in the County of Lee County, Florida will have exclusive jurisdiction of all
            disputes arising out of or related to this ToU or your use of the Site or the Service and agree to submit to
            the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Julio Sales Group shall
            be allowed to apply for equitable remedies (including injunctions) in any jurisdiction.
            <br /> <br />


            <h3>18.Binding Arbitration.</h3>
            <strong> 18.1.</strong> Arbitration Procedures. You and Julio Sales Group agree that, except as provided in
            Section 18.4
            below, all disputes, controversies and claims related to this ToU (each a “Claim”), shall be finally and
            exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written
            notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and
            binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
            Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Rules”) and under
            the terms set forth in this ToU. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 18
            and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 18 will control and prevail.
            Except as otherwise set forth in Section 18.4, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal,
            state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and Julio Sales Group
            will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The
            arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award
            given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The
            determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
            and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this ToU,
            <br />
            <strong> (a)</strong> you and
            Julio Sales Group may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or
            confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and
            <br />
            <strong> (b)</strong> the arbitrator’s
            decision shall be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided
            that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.
            <strong> BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND JULIO SALES GROUP WAIVE THE
                RIGHT TO
                SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</strong>
            <br />
            <strong> 18.2.</strong> Location. The arbitration will take place in Cape Coral, Florida, unless the parties
            agree to video,
            phone and/or internet connection appearances.
            <br />
            <strong> 18.3.</strong> Limitations. You and Julio Sales Group agree that any arbitration shall be limited
            to the Claim
            between Julio Sales Group and you individually. YOU AND JULIO SALES GROUP AGREE THAT
            <br />
            <strong>
                (a) THERE IS NO RIGHT
                OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION
                PROCEDURES;
                <br />
                (b) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED
                REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR
                AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND
                <br />
                (c) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.
            </strong>
            <br />
            <strong> 18.4.</strong> Exceptions to Arbitration. You and Julio Sales Group agree that the following Claims
            are not subject
            to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration:
            <br />
            <strong> (a)</strong> any Claim seeking to enforce or
            protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Julio Sales Group’s intellectual property rights;
            <br />
            <strong> (b)</strong> any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of
            privacy or unauthorized
            use; and
            <br />
            <strong> (c)</strong> any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert
            an
            individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in
            lieu of arbitration.
            <br />
            <strong> 18.5.</strong> Arbitration Fees. If you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will need to pay the
            JAMS arbitration
            initiation fee. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for
            initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS
            Rules.
            <br />
            <strong> 18.6.</strong> Severability. You and Julio Sales Group agree that if any portion this Section 18 is
            found illegal or
            unenforceable (except any portion of Section 18.4), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the
            Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 18.4 is found to be illegal or unenforceable then
            neither you nor Julio Sales Group will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section
            18.4 found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of
            competent jurisdiction within the County of Cape Coral, State of Florida, United States of America, and you
            and Julio Sales Group agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
